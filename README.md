Then create idividual Movie objects by calling media.Movie() and supplying it with three arguments -- title, poster_url, and trailer_url. Lastly, to generate the movie trailers page, call fresh_tomatoes.open_movies_page() and supply it with an array of the movie objects you created.

A more detailed example with multiple movie objects, which is used for the demo, can be found in entertainment_center.py
